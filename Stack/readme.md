# Stack

A stack is a fundamental data structure used in computer science, which follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

## Key Operations of a Stack

1. Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
2. Pop: Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
3. Peek/Top: Returns the top element without removing it from the stack.
4. IsEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty (i.e., contains no elements).
5. IsFull: Checks if the stack is full (only in the case of a fixed-size stack).

## Stack Characteristics

1. LIFO (Last In, First Out): The last element pushed onto the stack is the first one that will be popped off.
2. Dynamic/Fixed size: Stacks can either be dynamic (grow and shrink as needed) or fixed-size (with a set limit on the number of elements).
3. Memory Management: Stacks are typically implemented with arrays or linked lists
